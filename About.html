  2. PRODUCT OFFERING
We will be manufacturing slippers that are very strong on the outside while really soft on the inside, we noticed that most slippers we buy do not last for long, the start to get uncomfortable after a week or two so we saw an opportunity to sell our soft cotton quality slippers that are more durable. We are going to set up a social media page where people can be able to contact us and place their orders and also exercise personal selling on campus and off campus. Once someone places an order on our page, they would have to pay a 50% deposit on the mpesa registered number which we will provide then they will pay the rest upon delivery. As we go on and if the demand proves to be high we will sell for cash when are doing personal selling and maybe extend our product line with socks and night wear.
